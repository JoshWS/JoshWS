# Hey there! 👋

I'm **Josh**, a data engineer based in the Netherlands.

I build data pipelines and make messy data behave itself.

If there's data to scrape, transform, or orchestrate, I'm probably already thinking about how to containerize it.

My main tech stack is **Python, Scrapy, AWS (S3, Athena), Docker, Prefect, and FastAPI**. I spend most of my time wrangling web scrapers and building workflows that actually work at scale.

I've built a bunch of data pipelines, but my favorite projects involve turning chaotic web data into clean, structured datasets that people can actually use.

## Fun Facts:
- I run a Minecraft server and write Java plugins in my spare time
- I just got married! 🎉
- Hobbies: gaming, working out, watching tv, sleeping
